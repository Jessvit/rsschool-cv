## About myself:

For over 12 years I’ve been working as an economist. In general I like my current job, but it doesn’t excite me as it used to. So I decided to try something new (some say it’s never too late). I’m a responsible and observant person, also a good team worker. And I am up to gain new useful skills in a frontend development, and – who knows – maybe a fresh start in my career.
